### Problem Statement 
Otterlive has several problems such as:
- Inventory handling (inputting products is troublesome),
- Dashboard utility (not fully utilised and lacks information on the types of actions users can take), 
- Product and Promotion codes (troublesome to create and assign codes manually) 
- User-friendliness (the target audience of Otterlive lack tech expertise to fully utilise certain features). 

### Our Solutions 

#### Simplifying Inventory Management 
1. Currently : Users must manually input each item they are selling, including quantity, weight, category, price.
   Solution : Implement customisable templates which create multiple blank items at once and add additional features such as cloning/duplicating items for faster use.

2. Currently : Users have no indication of what items were previously sold/what items are currently being sold.
   Solution : Implement a history function in order to see previous products that were sold, as well as a 'Current Products' widget to show what is available during their livestreams.

#### Providing additional dashboard utility
1. Currently : Dashboard is not that helpful for the digitally-illiterate audience which are the target users of the app.
   Solution : Have the dashboard correspond to individual sessions, so they get an overview of their performance + live feedback while they are selling, as well as provide other helpful recommendations in order to maximise their revenue (eg. generates a promotion code for an item that is high in stock and no one is buying).

2. Currently : Dashboard does not summarise item stocks, need to go to "Inventory" or "Session" pages in order to view current stock.
   Solution : Merge the session/dashboard functionalities to provide an overview of the items that are currently in stock/out of stock.
   
#### Simplifying inputting product/promotion codes
1. Currently : Must input product/promotion codes on your own, as well as specifying what discounts you wish to give to the user/other parameters.
   Solution : Auto-generate product/promotion codes as items are being added to the inventory, part of functionality described in Dashboard Idea #1.
   
#### Enhancing user-friendliness
1. Currently : Brief tutorial that goes through what functionalities are available, but does not delve deeply into any specific function.
   Solution : Provide a step-by-step tutorial for people to host their first live-selling session, going through product creation till the order acceptance stage.
   
2. Currently : No FAQ section/chatbot in order to help with customer service.
   Solution : Provide an FAQ section.
